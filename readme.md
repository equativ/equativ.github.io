## Contributing

Contribution is done through GitLab, and mirrored to GitHub. The blog is hosted on GitHub Pages.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install [Hugo, see instructions here](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
3. Run `hugo serve` to have the blog running locally, so you can see how it looks
4. Copy any existing article from `content/articles/` and start from this to write your own article. Make sure to include a cover picture, preferably in 2048x720 pixels (or this aspect ratio).
5. Create a Merge Request and ask your peers for a review
6. When done, merge it, and GitLab will automatically mirror it to GitHub, triggering the deployment of the blog (it takes a minute or two)
